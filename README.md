analysis of data on the spread of COVID-19 around the world and prediction of the number of positive cases, deaths and recovered cases for each country.
Over the past decade, digital technologies have played a key role in key health sector
issues, including disease prevention, with the current global health emergency also
seeking technological support to combat COVID-2019. In a paper, the authors
highlighted the possible applications of digital technology trends such as Internet of
Things (IoT), mega-data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning and block
chain technology to develop strategies for surveillance, detection and prevention of
epidemics; and also to identify the impact of the epidemic on the health sector [9]. In a
research paper proposed by Benvenuto et al [10], the authors proposed an
autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) to predict the spread of
COVID-2019. In this paper, the author predicted the different parameters for the next
2 days based on the study on the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. This
research work also demonstrates the correlogram and the ARIMA prediction graph for
the incidence and prevalence of the epidemic.
Deb et al [11] proposed a time series method to analyse the incidence pattern and
estimated replication number of the COVID-19 epidemic. They conducted a statistical
analysis to explore trends in the epidemic to highlight the current epidemiological
status of a region so that different policies can be identified to address the COVID-19
pandemic in different countries. Depending on the current situation, understanding
patterns of early spread of infection is essential for planning and controlling effective
security measures. In this sense, Kucharski et al. proposed a scientific model of critical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using different data sets to study the COVID-19 epidemic
inside and outside Wuhan. With this, they explored the possible spread of an epidemic
outside Wuhan [12].
Recently, several studies have been conducted on the epidemiological COVID-19
epidemic using exploratory data analysis (EDA) based on various available data sets.
The studies focus primarily on the occurrence of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries
in Wuhan and the rest of the world to understand the suspected threats and subsequent
planning of containment activities [13]. Lauer et al, in their research, raised the issue
of the criticality of the incubation period for COVID-19. They studied 181 confirmed
cases and identified that the incubation period can vary from 5 days to 14 days and on
this basis better monitoring and control activities can be planned [14]. In recent
research, Singer analysed data from 25 infected counties to track short-term
predictions of the COVID 2019 epidemic. The research found that the rate of spread of
the site-specific disease follows a steady or explosive growth in the power law with
different scaling exponents. With this understanding, the authors analyzed the impact
of lock-in in various parts of the world [15]. Based on the above literature, it is evident
that enough work is available on the analysis of exploratory data to understand the
current trend of the epidemic, but there is still much scope to develop and test effective
predictive models based on machine learning so that proactive strategies can be
identified to address immediate needs.
